This directory (and the resulting tarball) contains a build tree with
examples, Makefiles, etc that demonstrate how to write signal
processing blocks for the GNU Radio system.  This directory is
intentionally distributed separately from the unified tarball of the
rest of GNU Radio in order to avoid problems for people who have begun
to write blocks with a modified copy of gr-howto-write-a-block.

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost and
cppunit.

To build the examples from the tarball use the normal recipe:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check

If you're building from git, you'll need to use this sequence, since
git doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
